# Conversational AI Security Investigation Platform

An AI-first security investigation platform that ingests security events, normalizes them, scores risk, correlates suspicious behavior, and lets an analyst investigate through a conversational interface.

## What It Does

- Collects security events through an ingestion API
- Normalizes mixed raw inputs into a shared event model
- Applies traffic analysis and log analysis
- Triggers rule-backed alerts
- Stores dedicated `traffic_events` and `log_events` alongside raw and normalized data
- Scores anomalies with an Isolation Forest-based AI service
- Correlates related activity into incidents
- Tracks actor risk history
- Produces first-class host and user risk scores
- Answers investigation questions in a grounded AI chat workflow
- Runs the public demo with the built-in grounded response engine, without using any external API key
- Lets buyers connect OpenAI, Groq or another OpenAI-compatible model with their own API key
- Presents everything in a dashboard and research workspace

## Architecture

- `apps/platform-api`
  Spring Boot platform for ingestion, normalization, rules, actors, alerts, incidents, and investigation orchestration
- `apps/ai-service`
  FastAPI service for anomaly scoring and grounded investigation response generation
- `apps/web`
  React investigation workspace with auth, overview, event stream, alerts, incidents, actors, anomalies, rules, sources, host/user risk context, scenario replay, and AI chat
- `infra/postgres/init`
  PostgreSQL schema bootstrap
- `datasets/demo-scenarios`
  Replayable bundled demo scenarios
- `scripts`
  Seed and replay utilities

## Local Run

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Then open:

- `http://localhost:3000` for the UI
- `http://localhost:8080` for the platform API
- `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the AI service OpenAPI page

Default credentials:

- Analyst: `analyst / analyst123`
- Admin: `admin / admin123`

These credentials are for local demos only. Change `APP_AUTH_ADMIN_PASSWORD`,
`APP_AUTH_ANALYST_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` before exposing the stack
outside your machine.

The NT Works public demo keeps live LLM calls disabled with
`DEMO_LLM_DISABLED=true`, so it never uses the site owner's personal API key.
Production buyers can set `DEMO_LLM_DISABLED=false` and add their own provider
credentials.

Free online option with Groq:

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=groq
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
GROQ_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
```

OpenAI option:

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Without a customer-provided key, the platform stays usable through the grounded
fallback response path.

## Demo Flow

Seed all bundled demo scenarios:

```bash
./scripts/seed_demo_data.sh
```

Then sign in and try these questions in the AI chat:

- `Which IP is the riskiest right now?`
- `Why did this alert trigger?`
- `Are these events connected?`
- `Why is 185.24.91.18 risky?`
- `Write a short non-technical summary.`

## Current Completion Status

This repo now covers the full AI-first target defined for the project:

- event ingestion through single, queue, and file-upload flows
- dedicated `traffic_events` and `log_events` persistence
- normalized event storage with tags
- traffic and log analysis
- rule engine plus managed rule catalog
- anomaly detection and incident correlation
- actor history and risk scoring plus first-class host and user risk outputs
- enriched alerts with supporting evidence, anomaly contribution, related incidents, recommendation, acknowledgment state, and resolution state
- durable investigation sessions, messages, and recommendations
- grounded AI explanations with optional live OpenAI-compatible model integration
- protected dashboard, event stream, rules, sources, and AI investigation workspace
